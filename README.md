# COMM4190 Spring 2025 - Research Project


### Overview

AI and LLMs are shaping the way we view and consume media. This is already implicating various positive and negative effects on related processes of much greater stakes. For instance, political messaging is already charged with volatile influences on democratic processes and polarization within the U.S. Unfortunately with the advent of more advanced AI and LLM technologies, the current effects seen within this scope is amplified, both the good and the bad.

Of course, it should be reiterated there are both positive and negative opportunities presented with this technology, and we'd be remissed to not consider both sides of the coin. My exploration of this subject-LLM and AI influence within the realm of political messaging and the political landscape-will consider the various contexts with which this technology can be used, and the associated effects of its usage. The aim will be to synthesize and reflect some of the many opinions surrounding this topic, and determining whether or not one side outweighs the other. This paper will also consider potential remedies and solutions against the negative implications that surface in my findings. Finally, I will also supplement some of these findings with direct engagements with the LLMs themselves (ChatGPT-4o), guaging their opinions on the matter and examining some of the possible biases that this research claims exists.
