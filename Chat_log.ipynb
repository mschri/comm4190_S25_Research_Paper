Trump garnered 312 electoral votes to Harris's 226 and won the popular vote with 49.8%, marking the first time a Republican has won the popular vote since 2004. He carried all seven swing states, including Nevada, which hadn't voted Republican since 2004 .([Wikipedia][1], [Wikipedia][2])\n",

    "President Joe Biden initially sought re-election but faced mounting concerns over his age and cognitive health. A particularly poor debate performance in June 2024 intensified these worries, leading to calls from over 30 senior Democrats for him to step aside. On July 21, Biden withdrew from the race and endorsed Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee .([The New Yorker][3], [Wikipedia][4])\n",

Thousands of protesters gathered in Washington, D.C., to oppose the certification of the 2020 presidential election results, which declared Joe Biden the winner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following a speech by President Trump near the White House‚Äîduring which he repeated claims that the election had been stolen‚Äîlarge groups of demonstrators marched to the Capitol building. As Congress met in a joint session to certify the Electoral College vote, rioters overwhelmed Capitol police, breached security perimeters, and entered the Capitol itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chaos resulted in the evacuation and lockdown of lawmakers, staff, and journalists inside. Offices were ransacked, chambers were occupied, and the certification proceedings were halted for several hours. Tragically, the events led to multiple deaths, including a Capitol police officer and several rioters, and many more were injured.\n",

    "\n",
    "Earlier that day, President Trump addressed a crowd near the White House, reiterating baseless claims that the 2020 presidential election had been ‚Äústolen.‚Äù He encouraged attendees to march to the Capitol, where lawmakers were in the process of certifying the Electoral College victory of President-elect Joe Biden.\n",
    "\n",
    "By early afternoon, that demonstration turned into a full-scale breach of the Capitol grounds. Rioters overwhelmed Capitol Police, smashed windows, and broke through barricades. Hundreds flooded into the Senate and House chambers, as well as congressional offices. Lawmakers were evacuated, and the certification process was halted for several tense hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scene was chaotic and deeply alarming. Confederate flags and pro-Trump banners waved in the rotunda. Makeshift gallows were erected outside. Capitol Police officers fought hand-to-hand battles to defend the chambers. Tragically, five people died as a result of the violence, including Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick.\n",
    "\n",
    "The FBI later classified the incident as domestic terrorism. In the aftermath, more than 1,000 individuals were arrested and charged, with investigations revealing ties to extremist groups such as the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys.
